= Updating =

Automatic updates should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.

== Shortcodes ==

A basic shortcode will embed your posts using your default profile settings. However, you may wish customize things - this is done via parameters added to the shortcode.

e.g. `[my_medium limit=3]`

Which options are available depends upon the users's set-up.

* **limit** - number of posts that will be showed on list, max. 15 (default 3).

Widgets can be easily added. In Administration simply click on the Widgets option under the Appearance menu. My Medium Article will be one of the listed widgets. Drag it to the appropriate sidebar on the right hand side and then choose your options.
